### Simple Static Pages in Rails
For when you want to have some *static-ish* pages rendered with minimal configuration within the Rails stack, with sensible defaults including caching, asset pipeline, and nice URLs.

### Requirements
============
Rails 4

### Installation
Packaged as a gem, so the usual bundler procedure applies

```
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ gem 'has_pages', git: "https://github.com/beautifulcode/has_pages.git
$ bundle
```

### Example Use
============

You have a set of semi static pages that should be served if no other routes are matched.

For example, given the following request `/about/company`, this will look in `app/views/pages/about/company`

The page will be rendered in the application layout by default, but will use an `about` layout if it exists.

This also provides page caching by default of these pages so Rails doesn't get involved on further requests to the same path.

Eventually, a macro of has_pages(options) can be called from your application controller to customize the behaviour of the plugin.

Some macro options could include:

  * Caching On/Off
  * Cache Directory
  * Alternate Layout(s)
  * Path Prefix
