HasPages
========

WORK IN PROGESS!! There may be significant changes.

Simple Engine to allow Rails app to have "static" pages rendered in a layout.


Example
=======

You have a set of semi static pages that should be served if no other routes are matched.

For example, given the following request /about/company, this will look in app/views/pages/about/company

The page will be rendered in the application layout by default, but will use an "about" layout if it exists.

This also provides page caching by default of these pages so Rails doesn't get involved on further requests to the same path.

Eventually, a macro of has_pages(options) can be called from your application controller to customize the behaviour of the plugin.

Some macro options could include: 
  
  * Caching On/Off
  * Cache Directory
  * Alternate Layout(s)
  * Path Prefix
  * Others?
